NETWORKING Troubleshoot connectivity issues steps : 0 1 2 3	- check if the server application is listening on a specific port (netstat) - ping the default gateway of the lan (route -n and ping it) --KO, then problem on the lan --OK, ping a public ip on the internet (ping 8.8.8.8, ping 1.1.1.1) ---KO, internet connectivity issue ---OK, ping an internet domain (ping google.com) ----KO, dns issue
NETWORKING SSH troubleshoot steps :	"-check if ssh daemon is running on server machine : systemctl ssh status -then, if error msg ""WARNING REMOTE HOST IDENFITICATION HAS CHANGED"" (appears if ip or mac address of the server has changed) : verify if you are connected to the right server --if OK : go to host file (vim .ssh/known_hosts) and remove the server's key. ---KO, check if the ssh port is open (from the client, scan the port 22 of the server : telnet serveripaddress 22 OR nmap -p 22 serveripaddress -Pn) ----if KO, check if there is a firewall from server side dropping the packet (iptables -vnL) -----if firewall ok, but connection always ko , run the ssh client in verbose mode (ssh -v username@serveripa) -----if KO, check the server locks in the log file (tail -f /var/log/auth.log)"
NETWORKING SSH Securing (10)	1 backup and edit the server config file then restart the server 2 use a non standard port for the server io 22 3 disable direct route login (most dangerous security breaches is to allow direct login) 4 Use strong password OR BETTER Disable password auth entirely and enable only public key auth 5 Allow restricted lists of users 6 Filter ssh access from the firewall by restricting ips allowed to access 7 use SSH protocol v2 8 configure an idle timeout interval 9 MaxAuthTries / MaxStartups / LoginGraceTime 10 Always use latest version of openssh 1 /etc/ssh/sshd_config 2 Port 2278 3 check is option #PermitRootLogin is well disabled or put it to PermitRootLogin no 4 - another course on that 5 AllowUsers student vince vboxuser 6 iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2278 -s 2.2.4.5 -j ACCEPT 7 - 8 ClientAliveInterval 300 ClientAliveCountMax 0
SOFTWARE Source compilation step	"- install the prerequisites : gcc, g++, make (Ubuntu : sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential, CentOS : sudo dnf group install ""Development Tools"") - download the source file from the official website - chech the integrity of the tarball (hash or digital signature) md5sum file for example - extract the archive and move into the resulting directory - ./configure --help and set the required compilation options - make - make install - remove the not need anymore source files"
